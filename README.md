# 🚀 Introducing MediCheck 

Navigating healthcare shouldn’t feel like a maze. Patients and clinicians both need quick, seamless access to session data, forms, and conversations—without redundant steps. That’s why we built MediCheck, an AI-powered platform that streamlines patient–provider interactions with voice-enabled chat, document management, and smart session tracking.

MediCheck is an AI-powered platform designed to streamline healthcare interactions by providing seamless access to session data, forms, and patient–clinician communication. It integrates Whisper for voice-to-voice interaction and our chatbot, powered by DeepSeek and Llama 3.2, runs on self-hosted servers, ensuring fast and secure responses for sensitive medical data. With a RAG pipeline, AstraDB for vector search, and a multi-model AI orchestration system, MediCheck synchronizes chatbot conversations, forms, and documents in real-time. The platform is built using TypeScript, Next.js, React, Tailwind, and Python, with AI models deployed on Google Cloud and self-hosted infrastructure.

## 💡 Challenges & Wins
🔄 Real-Time Sync – Ensuring chatbot conversations, forms, and documents stay synchronized across patient and provider views.

🔐 Security & Compliance – Managing role-based access so hospitals see only relevant patient data while keeping sessions secure.

🖥️ Unified Data Model – No more lost context—chatbot sessions, medical documents, and patient interactions are all linked together.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
📌 Designing for Real Users – Early wireframing & user flow mapping saved us from major redesigns later.

📌 Context-Rich AI > Generic Chatbots – Giving AI access to structured data dramatically improves responses.

📌 Healthcare Compliance is Tough! – Security, permissions, and audit logs were non-negotiable.
